FindMurder version 1.0 
13.08.2017

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The aim of the project is to find the murders in the novels of "A Song of Ice and Fire" using text-mining.

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
-------------------

- Before using the program, you need to install Python 3.4 and the NLTK.
- The program uses following files: NamedEntities.txt, Synonyms.txt, book.txt
  The first two files can be found in this folder. Because of copyright and license agreements, we are not allowed to upload any books.
- To use the program, you have to download all required files and save them in one folder. Then execute the file FindMurder.py.
- The output will show all found sentences with their potential subjects and objects.
- Further, you will find two other files called jon_knows_nothing.py and winter_is_coming.py. These two programs do not belong to this project directly, they were created mostly for fun. The programs count how often the phrases "You know nothing, Jon Snow" and "Winter is coming" occur in the books.
